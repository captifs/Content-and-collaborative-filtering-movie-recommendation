We have created an application that helps us analyze several algorithms related to recommendation systems. 
An overview of the algorithms can be found in the file recsysbigdata.pptx
We used the Surpriselib library. More information about the library can be found here https://surpriselib.com
The folder ml-latest-small contains the datased used in the application. 
In this data set we have 100004 ratings for 9125 movies.  You can see more info about this dataset on the file ml-latest-small/README.txt
In order to better structure the project, we created a folder for each chapter specific to the project. 
For example, for the first chapter we can open the Evaluating folder and run TestMetrics.py
For the next chapter in which we build our own framework, we can run the RecsBakeOff.py file from the Framework folder
For content-based filtering, enter the ContentBased folder and run ContentRecs.py and so on.
