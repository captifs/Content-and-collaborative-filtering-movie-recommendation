## Movie Recommendation with Surpriselib 

- We have created an application that helps us analyze several algorithms related to recommendation systems. 
-  We used the Surpriselib library. More information about the library can be found here https://surpriselib.com  
We ran the application on Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment, included with Anaconda. 
- An overview of the algorithms can be found in the file recsysbigdata.pptx
- The ml-latest-small folder contains the datasets used in the application. In this data set we have 100004 ratings for 9125 movies. You can see more information about this dataset in the file ml-latest-small/README.txt
- In order to better structure the project, we created a folder for each chapter specific to the project. 
For example, for the first chapter we can open the Evaluating folder and run TestMetrics.py.
For the next chapter in which we build our own framework, we can run the ```RecsBakeOff.py``` file from the Framework folder.
For content-based filtering, enter the ContentBased folder and run ContentRecs.py and so on.
